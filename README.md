# PythonFunctionsAssignment

The overarching goal for each of these programs is to use functions to do it in as few lines as possible!

1. Write a program to print the lyrics of the song “Old MacDonald.” Your program should print the lyrics for five different animals, similar to the example verse below:

Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh! 
And on that farm he had a cow, Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh! 
With a moo, moo here and a moo, moo there.
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo, moo. 
Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh!

2. Write a program to print the lyrics for ten verses of “The Ants Go Marching.” A sample verse is given below. You may choose your own activity for the little one in each verse, but be sure to choose something that makes the rhyme work (or almost work).

The ants go marching one by one, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching one by one,
The little one stops to suck his thumb,
And they all go marching down...
In the ground ...
To get out ...
Of the rain.
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

3. Write a function that computes the area of a triangle given the length of its three sides as parameters. (You may need to look up the formula for finding the area using all three sides if you don't know it already.)

4. Write and test a function to meet this specification: 

drawFace(center, size, win)
    center is a Point, size is an int, win is a GraphWin. Draws a simple face of given size in win.
    
Your function can draw a simple smiley (or grim) face. Demonstrate the function
by writing a program that draws several faces of varying size in a single window.
